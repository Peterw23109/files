                Doraemon is a robotic cat from the 22nd century, sent back in time to help a boy named Nobita Nobi. 
                Sent by Nobitaâ€™s future grandson, Doraemonâ€™s mission is to improve Nobitaâ€™s life so his descendants can live happily.
                With his special 4D pocket filled with futuristic gadgets like the Anywhere Door and Take-copter, Doraemon is no ordinary robot. 
                Though made of metal, he shows kindness, fear, and joy â€” just like a human. Heâ€™s always ready to help Nobita through school troubles, bullies, and wild adventures.

                Nobita is a kind but unlucky boy who always seems to be in trouble â€” from failing tests to getting picked on. 
                He struggles with school and sports, but he never gives up. Doraemon was sent to guide him toward a better future. 
                Even when Nobita makes mistakes, his deep care for others and good heart make him truly special â€” and thatâ€™s why Doraemon never stops believing in him.
